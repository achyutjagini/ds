Double hashing is a collision resolving technique in
 Open Addressed Hash tables.
 Double hashing uses the idea of applying a 
second hash function to key when a
collision occurs.

(hash1(key) + i * hash2(key)) % TABLE_SIZE
 Here hash1() and hash2() are hash functions and TABLE_SIZE
is size of hash table.
We repeat by increasing i when collision occurs

First hash function is typically hash1(key) = key % TABLE_SIZE
