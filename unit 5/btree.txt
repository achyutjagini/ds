B-Tree is a self-balancing search tree. 
In most of the other self-balancing search trees (like AVL  Trees),
it is assumed that everything is in main memory.
To understand the use of B-Trees, we must think of the huge amount of data
that cannot fit in main memory.


 When the number of keys is high, 
the data is read from disk in the form of blocks.
 Disk access time is very high compared to the main memory access time. 
 The main idea of using B-Trees is to reduce the number of disk accesses.
